# Default Interface

The default RoCC interface is composed of 3 subgroups, namely the Control, Register and Memory mode signals.

<div class="warning">
A comprehensive list of the signals, with short descriptions and their default values, is provided from a designersâ€™ and accelerators point of view!
This means:
<ul>
<li>Input is data FROM the main core TO the accelerator.</li>
<li>Output is data FROM the accelerator TO the main core.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Core control (CC)
The core control signals listed below ensure co-ordination between the core and accelerator.
All the signal names are prefixed with `cc_` to denote the group they belong to.

| Direction | Signal Name    | Default Value | Description                                                                                    |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Output    | `cc_busy`      | `false.B`     | The accelerator has memory requests in-flight and cannot be interrupted.                       |
| Input     | `cc_status`    | `false.B`     | Set when a privileged process is running on the core.                                          |
| Output    | `cc_interrupt` | `false.B`     | Set by the accelerator to indicate a problem.                                                  |
| Input     | `cc_exception` | `false.B`     | Set by the core to signal an exception has occured.                                            |
| Input     | `host_id`      | hart ID       | Used to distinguish which command comes from which hart.<br>NOTE: Bit width = log2(num_harts) |

## Register mode (Core)
The Register mode signals are composed of the RoCC Command and Response subgroups.
All the signal names are prefixed with `core_` to denote their source.

### Accelerator Requests
The RoCC Command signals are used by the core to send instructions to the accelerator and are driven directly by the RoCC Instruction of the RISC-V ISA.
The RoCC instruction is shown in Figure 2 which indicates bit widths and positions above and below the respective fields within the instruction.

| Direction    | Signal Name            | Default Value              | Description                                                                               |

### Accelerator Responses
An RoCC response to the command (if expected) is sent by the accelerator using the response interface.

| Direction     | Signal Name       | Default Value | Description                                                                                                          |

## Memory mode (Mem)
The memory interface is composed of Memory request and Memory response subgroups.
All the signal names are prefixed with `mem_` to denote the group they belong to.

### Memory Requests **from** Accelerator
Memory requests from the accelerator are sent out using the signals described below.

### Memory Responses **to** Accelerator
Memory responses to the accelerator are passed through signal interface described below.
There is a response for **both** load and store requests.
Usually an accelerator may use just the tag and data fields from the response.

<div class="warning">
There is no <code>ready</code> signal from the accelerator to acknowledge the acceptance of memory responses, which means it is expected that accelerator will be ready to accept data in every cycle.
