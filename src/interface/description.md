# RoCC Interface Description

The signal names for both the ***default*** and the ***extended*** RoCC interfaces are elaborated from the Verilog generated from an example Chisel-based accelerator.
These Verilog interface names would be used by HLS tools to automatically generate the Verilog code for accelerators; optionally a Verilog interface that employs structs could be used as well.

<div class="warning">
Please note that signal directions & descriptions are from the acceleratorâ€™s perspective.
