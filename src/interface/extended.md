# Extended Interface
These signals are included only if RoCC is configured to include them.
Please note the below list of signals is not comprehensive but only for representational purposes.

## TileLink
There are two type of TileLink connections: arbitrated and non-arbitrated, and both are not handled by the cache subsystem of Rocket.
Arbitrated uncached tilelink is abbreviated aUTL.
The unarbitrated uncached tilelink is abbreviated UTL.
The UTL group is composed of 2 subgroups namely aUTL which is arbitrated uncached tile link signals and UTL signals.

### Arbitrated Uncached TileLink (aUTL)
aUTL is arbitrated with the I-cache link to L2 memory system.
The aUTL set of signals is composed of AUTL acquire and grant subgroups as listed below.
All aUTL tables are prefixed with `autl_`.

#### aUTL Acquire/Request

### Uncached TileLink (UTL)
The UTL signals are a vector of signals of the same type as aUTL.
The size of the UTL vector is equal to the number of independent memory channels, which is configurable in the rocket core.
However these signals have yet to be investigated and added to this document.

## Floating Point Unit (FPU)
This interface may be used by the accelerator if it has a floating point unit attached to it.
All the signal names are prefixed with `fpu_` to denote the group they belong to.
The interface is composed of FP request and FP response sub-bundles, as shown below.

## Control Status Register (CSR)
Control status registers may be used optionally within the accelerator.
If they exist, the interface signals in Table 10 can be used by the operating system on the core to memory map the accelerator.
Its mechanism is to be added and will be discussed in later versions of the document.
All the signal names are prefixed with `csr_` to denote the group they belong to.

| Direction            | Signal Name | Default Value | Description                                                                                   |

| Input [63:0]         | `csr_wdata` | Data          | Data to write into a CSR.<br>NOTE: Must be present for every request. Can be `0.U` for reads. |

| Output [63:0]        | `csr_rdata` | Data          | Contents of the CSR read from.                                                                |

## Page Table Walker (PTW)
The page table walker signals are used for address translation from the accelerator (if the core isnâ€™t already handling it).
These signals will be added as a part of future work.
All the signal names will be prefixed with `ptw_` to denote the group they belong to.

Please stay tuned for updates.
