For more details about any information in the document, please do check some useful resources of the Berkeley RoCC tutorials which were referred while making this document:

Moreover, there is an example that integrates the Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) accelerator with the rocket core and is also tested against sample programs.
The SHA repository (with fixes by UCSD) and the rocket implementation are listed below.
Follow the instructions in the readme for simulations.
We will discuss this in greater detail in the following versions of the document.
